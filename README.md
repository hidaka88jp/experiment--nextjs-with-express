# experiment--nextjs-with-express

## 📌 Overview

This is an experimental spike project built with Next.js + Express + Prisma + MySQL.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Explore the integration between a Next.js frontend and an Express backend
- Experiment with API design and database interactions using Prisma
- Prototype a simple login flow and message board system
- Learn and validate architecture decisions before building a production-ready app
  
This project is not production-ready.
Many parts will be simplified or intentionally incomplete (e.g., no authentication, no security, no error handling, etc.).

## 🧪 Spike Characteristics

- Authentication is simplified (no JWT / cookie yet)
- Passwords are stored in plain text (ONLY for prototyping)
- Error handling is minimal
- No production-level architecture or optimization
- Structure and naming may change rapidly
- Purpose is speed & learning, not code quality

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- Express (REST API)
- Prisma ORM
- MySQL (Docker)
- Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 Goal

Once the spike succeeds,
a clean, production-quality full-stack project will be created separately (as a portfolio piece).
